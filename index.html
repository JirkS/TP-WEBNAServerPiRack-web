          The heart of the tech project lies in the powerful Raspberry Pi 4 Type
          B, a versatile single-board computer that provides the brains for
          endeavour. Enhancing the user interface is a small OLED RGB display,
          adding a vibrant visual element to the project. To ensure optimal
          performance and longevity, a dedicated fan has been integrated to keep
          the Raspberry Pi cool under varying workloads.

        <h6 class="tittleB">Case Rack</h6>
        <p>
          The physical housing for the tech setup is a product of modern design
          and manufacturing. Utilizing Rhinoceros 7 for precise 3D modeling, the
          case rack was printed on a Prusa MK4 3D printer, demonstrating the
          fusion of digital design and physical production. The assembly of the
          components into this custom-designed case rack ensures a sleek and
          functional enclosure for technological masterpiece.

          A robust online presence requires meticulous setup and configuration.
          Achieving this involves setting up a public IP address through my home
          router, installing and configuring the Nginx web server with the
          public IP address, purchasing a domain name, configuring DNS records
          in control panel of domain, and securing the website with an HTTPS
          certificate. The latter is implemented using Certbot by

          The user interface of the project comes to life through the
          development of a dynamic webpage using HTML and CSS. These
          foundational web technologies provide the structure and styling
          necessary for an engaging and visually appealing user experience. The
          integration of these elements showcases commitment to user-friendly
          design in the digital realm.

        <h6 class="tittleB">Display with Stats</h6>
        <p>
          Elevating the user experience to new heights, a dedicated display has
          been seamlessly integrated, providing real-time system statistics.
          Crafted with precision in Python, the script empowers the display to
          showcase essential metrics such as CPU usage, RAM statistics, and DISK
          performance. This dynamic presentation not only offers valuable
          insights into the Raspberry Pi's operations but also enhances user
          engagement. Furthermore, the public IP address is prominently
          featured, completing the comprehensive display and underscoring the
          versatility and functionality of Python-powered display of tech
          project.

          I am at 4th-year student at the Secondary Technical School of
          Electrical Engineering (SPŠE) Ječná, specializing in Information
          Technology. I am interested in positions in the IT field as a
          programmer or IT technician. I am reliable and capable of teamwork,
          patient, goal-oriented, and open to learning with new technologies. I
          plan to study at the Czech Technical University (ČVUT) and work
          part-time during my studies or work as a temporary worker. In my free
          time, I engage in 3D modeling using Rhinoceros software and am
          familiar with basic operation of 3D printers. In terms of sports, I
          prefer running, cycling, and strength training. I am a student of the
          II. cycle of the Conservatory of Music, playing the trombone, and I am
          a member of a brass band.
